🎥 Movies Store – Django Web Application

Movies Store is a full-stack Django web application that lets users browse movies, view details, write reviews, manage a shopping cart, and complete purchases. The project demonstrates a production-style MVC architecture with authentication, persistence, and a modern, custom-themed UI.

This project is designed as both a portfolio showcase and a practical demonstration of building a modular, scalable web application from scratch.
